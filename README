The search results of Google are not original links but all redirect URLs, so every entry's original link is encoded in the result. In one special situaiton, when the search results are back but the search session is cut, the redirect links will be invalid even their target sites are not blocked.
So I made this small Chrome extension, which is called Google Url Extractor, to avoid this problem. Install the extension, right click on one search result, choose the new added item in the menu, then it will decode the redirect link back and copy the original link into the clipboard.
